## About The Project

This is a Convolutional neural network model to classify image as horse or human. I took advantage of transfer learning to compensate data limitations. I used the Inception V3 model and added a fully connected layer to train for horse vs human classification.

### Built With

* tensorflow

## Accuracy
Training accuracy   : 98.68%  
Validation accuracy : 96.67%
